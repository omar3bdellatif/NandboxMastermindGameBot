The rules of this game are quite simple. Based on the chosen difficulty, you will be asked to guess a number consisting of 4 or 5 digits. Type in your guess using the provided keypad, then press enter. two numbers will then show up (For example 3:1), the first digit is the number of digits that you guessed correctly, while the second one is the number of digits that you guessed correctly AND in their correct position. To clarify, if the answer was 1234, and you guessed 4231, the number you'll get would be 4:2, because all numbers you guessed were correct, but only two of them were in the right position. If you want to give up the round, press the Solve Game button provided in the lower menu. Good luck!
